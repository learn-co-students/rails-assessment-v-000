#Need to add:
  -check dryness (dry up logging in layout)
  -log in/ admin check method inconsistent
  -add details

#UX needs
  -add note if no new slots available
  -big when submit new time_slot
  -time_slot show add who signed up for admin view
  -add message to time slot page if haven't signed up for any

#Maybe add
  -log in with google
  -confirmation pending/confirmed! to user time slots
  -admin approve a user
  -Look into fixing js instead of using a button_to
  -time slots should probably have a description
  -ugh should really be first name and last name
  -non fb users add a profile pic
  -if logged in via fb, shouldn't be able to change password
  -if previously logged in w/fb and made profile changes currently that will be overwritten upon relogin

#Future
  -notification if admin edits a time slot a user is signed up for
  -admin can mark people as attended
  -volunteer reports
  -volunteer types (technical non technical)
  -admin can sort for type of volunteer
  -reminder on home page for time slots coming up in 48 hours
  -email reminders
  -admin can email people
  -option to send availability and admin to confirm actual slots
  -admin gets notification if volunteer deletes a time slot
  -time slots coordinated by specific Admin

#Blog post
  -helper route names don't work check time slot index path for example
