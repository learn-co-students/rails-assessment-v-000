#Need to add:
  -field with errors
  -check dryness
  -update seeds
  -what happens if already have an account and try to log in with fb?
  -breaks if tries to sign up with non unique email, need to kick it back with errors
  -nested routes not secure!

#UX needs
  -add note if no new slots available
  -big when submit new time_slot
  -time_slot show add who signed up for admin view
  -add message to time slot page if haven't signed up for any
  -past time slots vs upcoming time slots

#Maybe add
  -log in with google
  -confirmation pending/confirmed! to user time slots
  -admin approve a user
  -Look into fixing js instead of using a button_to
  -time slots should probably have a description
  -ugh should really be first name and last name
  -non fb users add a profile pic
  -if logged in via fb, shouldn't be able to change password
  -if previously logged in w/fb and made profile changes currently that will be overwritten upon relogin

#Future
  -notification if admin edits a time slot a user is signed up for
  -admin can mark people as attended
  -volunteer reports
  -volunteer types (technical non technical)
  -admin can sort for type of volunteer
  -reminder on home page for time slots coming up in 48 hours
  -email reminders
  -admin can email people
  -option to send availability and admin to confirm actual slots
  -admin gets notification if volunteer deletes a time slot
  -time slots coordinated by specific Admin
